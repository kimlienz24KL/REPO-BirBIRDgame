# Project Cardano - BirdBird

## Overview

**BirdBird** is a blockchain-powered game built on the Cardano network, combining a Flappy Bird-inspired gameplay with the ability to mint tokens as rewards using the **Lucid** SDK. Players who score at least **3 points** in the game unlock the minting feature to receive corresponding tokens directly to their Cardano wallet.

## Features

The game includes fun mechanics inspired by Flappy Bird, integration with the Cardano blockchain for transparency and decentralization, token minting rewards for players who reach the 3-point threshold, and seamless blockchain interaction through the **Lucid** SDK.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/birdbird.git && cd birdbird`.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Create a `.env` file with Cardano wallet and API key details.
4. Start the application: `npm run dev`.

## Tools & Technologies

**Cardano Blockchain** ensures secure tokenization, **Lucid SDK** simplifies blockchain interaction, **React.js** powers the game interface, and **TypeScript** ensures code maintainability.
